# Quick Sort in Place (sub-linear space complexity)

This article aims to show the reader how to construct quick sort algorithm that uses sub-linear space and has logarithmic time complexity. Note that the worst case for time complexity is still O(n**2), but this approach minimizes the probability of the worst case.

## Overview

The approach we will be taking
